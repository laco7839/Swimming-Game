Swimming race game
# Overview
For this project, I created a simple two-player game. The swimmers race to the finish line. I worked with Claude to develop this game. Please see the video below to see how it works.

# Users
This game is for people who want to have fun and race in a heatlhy, competitive way. 
# Learnings
I am a passionate swimmer, so I have even dreamt about swimming races. Every detail needs to be perfect in a sprint, so I thought, "Why not make a silly, simple game that makes the race FUN?" I sketched my idea, added diving boards, the finish line, and made the swimmers more realistic. This helped me complete my vision to make a fun racing game. I learned more about Claude and how to speak to it with specific instrustions.
